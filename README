Dependency: 
	It's tested with the latest version of the HDF5 dev branch (commit 66842e3347a52e18aea227ba893a4d48ee0b80e7), but you don't necessarily need that particular version.
	Make sure you have libhdf5 shared dynamic libraries in your hdf5/lib. For Linux, it's libhdf5.so, for OSX, it's libhdf5.dylib.
	If you don't have the shared dynamic libraries, you'll need to reinstall HDF5:
		- Get the latest version of develop branch;
		- In the repo directory, run ./autogen.sh
		- In your build directory, run configure and make sure you DO NOT have option "--disable-shared", for example:
			 env CC=mpicc ../hdf5_dev/configure --enable-build-mode=debug --enable-internal-debug=all --enable-parallel
		- make; make install	 

Change following paths in Makefile:
	HDF5_DIR: path to your hdf5 install/build location, such as hdf5_build/hdf5/
	SRC_DIR: path to this VOL connector source code directory.
	

Set environment variables:
	export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=PATH_TO_YOUR_pass_through_vol
	export HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR="pass_through_ext under_vol=0;under_info={};"
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH_TO_YOUR_hdf5_build/hdf5/lib:$HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH

Then type make in the source dir and you'll see libh5passthrough_vol.so, which is the pass through VOL connector library. To run a demo,you can run hdf5/bin/h5ls h5_test.h5, and it should show many lines of debugging info like:
	------- PASS THROUGH VOL INIT
	------- PASS THROUGH VOL INFO String To Info
	------- PASS THROUGH VOL INFO Copy
By default the debugging mode is enabled to ensure the VOL connector is working. To disable it, simple remove the $(DEBUG) option from the CC line, and rerun make.
